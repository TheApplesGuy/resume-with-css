        <h2>Professional Objective</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Axel! I'm a Computer Science Student at UCF, and I'm interested in being a Software Engineer. I'm
          currently learning about web development and also developing my skills as a software engineer. As an
          aspiring software engineer, I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow my current set of skills.
          As of right now, I have a
          GPA of 3.0 and have a solid grasp in Java, JavaScript, C, Git, GitHub, and am currently learning HTML and
          CSS.
